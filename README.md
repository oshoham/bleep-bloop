# Bleep Bloop

This is a chat app that I made as an experiment to see whether you could send and receive text between two computers using sound. The chat was implemented using React, and the signal processing was done via the Web Audio API.

## How to Use

1. Get two computers.
2. Put them next to each other (as close as possible, ideally).
3. Turn the volume up all the way on each one.
4. In Chrome or FireFox, navigate to [https://bleepbloop.herokuapp.com](https://bleepbloop.herokuapp.com) on both computers.
5. Send a message from one computer.
6. Magic!

## Caveats

Doesn't work in Safari, or really any browsers other than Chrome and FireFox.

Probably won't work on most smartphones.

The original goal for this project was to use ultrasonic sound, but so far I haven't been able to find a device with speakers capable of emitting frequencies that high. If you have one and you can get this to work on it, let me know.
